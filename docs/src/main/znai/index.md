Klass is a rapid application development framework for Java with first class support for temporal data.

## Overview

Klass generates a complete application stack from a concise domain model definition, including:

- Database schema
- POJOs and DTOs
- REST services
- GraphQL endpoints
- Admin UI

## Guide structure

This guide walks through building a realistic subset of Stack Overflow functionality to demonstrate the framework's capabilities.

The guide is organized into several parts:

1. **Vision** - Core concepts including classes, associations, projections, and services
2. **Audit Data** - Temporal data modeling and audited services
3. **Bootstrapped Metamodel** - Dynamic querying and UI generation
4. **Additional Features** - Enumerations, parameterized properties, and aggregations
5. **Alternative Implementations** - Minimal viable product discussion
6. **Related Works** - Comparison with similar technologies
